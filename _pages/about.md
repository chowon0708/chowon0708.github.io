I'm **Shinwon Lee**, an undergraduate at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/), double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.
Before SNU, I completed the full curriculum at [Sejong Science High School](https://sjsh.sen.hs.kr/) in just two years — one of South Korea’s top STEM-focused schools.

I'm broadly interested in modern cryptography, privacy-enhancing technologies, and the foundations of computer security. In particular, I enjoy thinking about **lattice-based cryptography**, **fully homomorphic encryption**, and **zero-knowledge proofs**.
I've been fortunate to explore these topics as an undergraduate researcher at the SNU Crypto & Privacy Lab (with Prof. Yongsoo Song), and previously at the SNU Cryptography Lab (with Prof. Junghee Cheon).

I’m currently exploring opportunities for **Ph.D. programs starting Fall 2026**, and always happy to connect with people passionate about cryptography, security, and theory.
